# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a simple and versatile machine learning method used for classification and regression tasks. KNN is a non-parametric, lazy-learning algorithm that makes predictions based on the majority class of k-nearest neighbors in the feature space.

## Key Concepts:

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A type of instance-based learning where predictions are made based on the majority class of the k-nearest data points.

2. **Distance Metrics**: The choice of distance metric (e.g., Euclidean distance) determines how the algorithm measures the proximity of data points.

3. **Hyperparameter k**: The number of neighbors considered when making predictions. The value of k affects the model's sensitivity to local variations.

4. **Lazy Learning**: KNN is a lazy learner because it does not build an explicit model during training. Instead, it memorizes the training dataset and makes predictions at the time of testing.

## Application:

- **Classification Tasks**: KNN is commonly used for classification problems where the goal is to assign a label to an input based on its similarity to labeled examples.

- **Regression Tasks**: KNN can be adapted for regression tasks by predicting the average or weighted average of the target values of its k-nearest neighbors.

- **Data Clustering**: KNN can be used for clustering data points based on their similarity.

## Demonstration:

In this notebook, I apply KNN to a wine dataset, classifying different wines based on their chemical properties. The demonstration includes data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

Key steps in the notebook:

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the structure and features of the dataset.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

3. **Model Training**: Using scikit-learn to train a KNN classifier.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Exploring the impact of the choice of k on model performance.

5. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.

This demonstration provides insights into the application of KNN, its strengths, and considerations in choosing hyperparameters for optimal performance.
